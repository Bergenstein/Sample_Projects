# Sample_Projects

A list of sample projects!

This repository includes a list of sample projects on category theory, quantum computing, algorithmic trading, machine learning, deep learning and many more. Some of these projects are sampled from my work in the past that I have decided to make public. Others are ongoing work, especially category theory and its application to stochastic differential equations which is my ongoing active research at the University of Oxford.
